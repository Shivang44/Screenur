# Screenur ![Screenur Icon](http://i.imgur.com/pc9lOm9.png "Screenur Icon") 
A fast and minimal screenshot tool that instantaneously uploads screenshots to imgur.com

Developed in C++ using the Winapi (win32) along with GDI/GDI+ for graphics and libcurl for uploading to imgur. 

# Features
- **Automatically uploads screenshot to imgur, opens in browser, and copies url to clipboard**
- **Small**: Less than 500kb and very light on system resources
- **No install required** and no external dependancies
- **Completely open source** and images are never stored


# Usage
CTRL-SHIFT-3 - Captures and uploads fullscreen screenshot to imgur, opens in browser, and copies url to clipboard

CTRL-SHIFT-4 - Same as above but allows you to take a screenshot of a selectable region on your screen

# Download

**Note:** In Windows 8/10 you might be prompted by Windows saying Screenur is an unrecognized app. I can't afford a code-signing certificate to remove this warning ($100+), so you will have to [click "More Info" and then click "Run Anyway"](http://i.imgur.com/VYggA3r.png)
